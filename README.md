# Coding-Quiz

# Basic Use of This Code
This is a simple quiz designed too test your knowledge on an array of topics. 

# My Code Description 
It starts by defining variables for different elements of the quiz, such as the quiz container, the question container, the results container, the submit button, the timer, the quiz time, the current question index, and the score. It also defines an array of objects, where each object contains a question, answer options, and a correct answer.

Then there are several functions defined in the code. The startQuiz function renders the first question, starts the countdown timer, and adds an event listener to the submit button. The showQuestion function renders a single question with its answer options as radio buttons. The submitAnswer function handles the submission of an answer, checks if the answer is correct, moves to the next question, and ends the quiz if all questions have been answered. The endQuiz function clears the question container, hides the submit button, and displays the final score. The countdown function starts a countdown timer that updates the remaining time and displays it in the timer element, and ends the quiz when the time runs out.
